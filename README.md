# FormicForms
Forms are a tedious task, but crucial to coding. Forms are used for so many companies and webpages. They are used to order food, create a login, track viewers, and serve many other purposes. My FormicForm assignment is a very basic form that asks for specific details from the individual and creates an alert when the information is not sufficient for the built in requirements.
